# What is Green Mile's Fold A Bike?

We asked ourselves: 
> How might we improve the process of tripping for tourers and travellers in order to create a more seamless mobility experience?

*Green Mile's* Fold A Bike App introduces the new and innovative way of traveling and adventuring for leisure trip, by getting rid of troublesome obstacles that would usually slow down or stop the tour and travel experience. By making use of the flexibility and comfortability of the folding bike technology the adventures can be taken to the next level.   

As indicate by the challenge giver; In a possible cooperation with the most trusted and ingenious folding bike manufacturer - [BROMPTON BICYCLE](https://www.brompton.com) - a perfectly tailored bike for the users every desire can provided. May it be a simple sightseeing tour to visit famous spots or a hiking trip into the beautiful german mountains,  hunger for exploration knows no boundaries - anymore. Simply carry and pack up a folding bike, take it on one of the DB trains, busses, or cars - without additional charge and visit different monuments, cities, or landscapes in the most comfortable and flexible way.

Pre-designed tours or user created tours with our Plan-A-Trip-algorithm can connect to travelers, tourers and trippers, so they can undergo a joint journey.
