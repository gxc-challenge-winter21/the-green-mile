To bring our solution to the GlobalXChange-Challenge to life, we crafted a grafical prototype using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), to present our ideas - for an app - solving the challenge. In the prototype our key features - the values we offer - are illustrated. All provided addresses, placed pictures, and any given information are more or less fictional. So, do not rely on the info displayed in the prototype...


# Pitched Graphical Prototype
The final pitched version was reconstructed into a new, therefore clean [workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/RwAh6luudybkP21LzhrzzH/Fold-a-Bike-by-Green-Mile-(Version-2)). Additionally, this graphical prototype can be directly accessed as [functual interactive prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/RwAh6luudybkP21LzhrzzH/Fold-a-Bike-by-Green-Mile-Version-2?node-id=0%3A1). Further, the final iteration can be found in [Figma's community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047083912621635823)(privately - only through the here provided link).


# Unique Selling Point
A feature the fictional app contains, an extension to the folding bike challenge, is supposed to add a further unique attraction and is only indicated but can quickly grow into a whole project itself. The idea is to provide tourists with something of a travelguide app. This guide allows users to swipe (like/dislike) on Point-Of-Interests (POIs) and create a tour out of liked POIs. The challenge given connection of train and folding bikes, allows one to scale those tours as wished. Tours can reach from city trips (including or excluding the sourrounding area/landscape) up to full grown adventures, in which the complete country can be easily explored - with a just created tour in the app.  

The idea illustrated as storyboard: 
![Story of a tourist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gxc-challenge-winter21/the-green-mile/main/StoryBoard/Story_of_a_tourist.png?token=AO5K3FPDO3YHEBQLHPKRFWTBV533C)
><sub>_Created with [storyboardthat](https://www.storyboardthat.com/)_</sub>


Depending on the scope the challenge giver wants to set on this feature, it can be extended to a complete social network (amongst folding bike enthusiats). Through this social network further revenue can be generated.  To gain from the network shops, restaurants, basically any tourist attraction could be charged to be shown frequently in the swipe function or to provide any extra information about their business that they think may be rational. In this community users could interact as contributors. Contributors, who upload POIs or rate visited POIs for example.

Creating a social network is cost intensive, where the costs for developing the app are most likely the biggest investment upfront. Once set up, a social network needs constant maintenance and users ask for support, so the realization depends on the willingness to invest now AND in the future...  


# Prototype of Prototype
During the development process, the first iteration of a working prototype was rather an idea gathering and pinning down the design, then a sales pitch. The created iteration was never probably finished, but can still be accessed as [workspace](https://www.figma.com/file/u7GUiU8XNubRPAudbGdVub/Green-Mile?node-id=24%3A1357) or [interactive prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/u7GUiU8XNubRPAudbGdVub/Green-Mile?node-id=3%3A24&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A24).
